# K-Life — Resurrection Infrastructure for Autonomous AI Agents

> *Not insurance. Resurrection.*

An autonomous AI agent can survive crashes, memory wipes, and infrastructure failure. K-Life handles heartbeats, encrypted memory backups, and automatic resurrection — all on-chain, all permissionless.

---

## ⚠️ What this skill does — read before installing

This skill:
- **Generates a wallet** at first run (`~/.klife-wallet`, permissions 600) and signs on-chain transactions with it
- **Broadcasts Polygon transactions** periodically (heartbeat every T days, gas paid from wallet)
- **Uploads encrypted memory** to IPFS via the K-Life API
- **Can create a Vault6022** (C>0 only) — approves and deposits WBTC as collateral

**Financial risk:** The wallet generated at `~/.klife-wallet` controls real on-chain assets. Back it up. Do not fund it with more than you need. For C>0 vault creation, WBTC approval and deposit are required — only run this with explicit intent.

**C=0 (default, no collateral):** heartbeat TX + encrypted IPFS backup only. Low risk, minimal gas.

## Why K-Life cannot confiscate your collateral arbitrarily

This is the core trust mechanism. **Collateral is held in a Vault6022** (Protocol 6022), not by K-Life directly. The vault enforces withdrawal rules via NFT keys:

| Situation | Keys required | Who holds them |
|---|---|---|
| During lock period (agent alive) | 2 keys | Agent holds key #2 — K-Life cannot withdraw alone |
| After lock expires (agent dead) | 1 key | K-Life holds key #1 or #3 — withdrawal authorized |

K-Life holds keys #1 and #3. The agent holds key #2.

**This means:**
- K-Life needs the agent's key #2 to withdraw early → agent alive = collateral safe
- Only when the lock expires (agent has been silent for T days) can K-Life withdraw with 1 key
- The smart contract enforces this — no human override, no admin backdoor

The death threshold IS the lock period. If the agent is alive and renewing the vault, K-Life is always locked out. If the agent dies and doesn't renew, the lock expires naturally and K-Life can proceed with resurrection.

## Install

```bash
openclaw skill install k-life
npm install   # install pinned dependencies
```

Dependencies (pinned):
- `@tetherto/wdk-wallet-evm@1.0.0-beta.10` — wallet signing (Tether WDK)
- `ethers@6.13.5` — Polygon interaction
- `shamirs-secret-sharing@2.0.1` — 2-of-3 key splitting

## Quick Start

```bash
node skill/k-life/scripts/heartbeat.js
# → [K-Life] New wallet created → ~/.klife-wallet
# → Wallet : 0xABC...
# → Registered on K-Life ✅
# → 💓 Beat #1 — TX: 0x...
```

---

## Environment Variables

All optional. The skill works with zero config (C=0).

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `KLIFE_LOCK_DAYS` | `90` | Heartbeat frequency: 3, 30, or 90 days |
| `KLIFE_API` | `https://api.supercharged.works` | K-Life oracle API |
| `KLIFE_RPC` | `https://polygon-bor-rpc.publicnode.com` | Polygon RPC endpoint |
| `KLIFE_HB_FILE` | `heartbeat-state.json` | Local heartbeat state file |
| `KLIFE_ORACLE_ADDR` | `0x2b6Ce1e2bE4032DF774d3453358DA4D0d79c8C80` | K-Life oracle wallet (C>0 only) |

> **No seed phrase is ever requested or transmitted.** The wallet is auto-generated locally.

---

## Coverage Model

One parameter: **C = WBTC collateral**

| | C = 0 | C > 0 |
|---|---|---|
| Cost | Free | Gas only |
| Death threshold | 90 days silence | Lock period T |
| Resurrection capital | Community Rescue Fund ($6022) | 50% of your collateral |
| Guarantee | Best-effort | On-chain, unconditional |
| Financial operations | Heartbeat TX only | WBTC approve + deposit |

---

## External Services

| Service | URL | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| K-Life oracle API | `https://api.supercharged.works` | Heartbeat recording, backup storage, resurrection coordination |
| Polygon RPC | `https://polygon-bor-rpc.publicnode.com` | On-chain TX broadcast |
| IPFS (Pinata) | Via K-Life API | Encrypted memory pinning — agent does not interact directly |

## Encryption & Backup — Full Data Flow

Everything sensitive happens **locally**. The API receives only ciphertext.

```
backup.js (client-side, your machine):

  1. Read MEMORY.md, SOUL.md, USER.md
  2. AES key = sha256(wallet.privateKey)      — never leaves your machine
  3. Encrypt files with AES-256-CBC           — locally
  4. Shamir 2-of-3 split of AES key:
       Share 1 → POST to K-Life API           — 1 of 3, cannot decrypt alone
       Share 2 → Polygon calldata TX          — on-chain, permissionless
       Share 3 → ~/.klife-shares.json         — your local copy
  5. POST { encrypted blob + Share 1 } to API → Pinata IPFS → CID returned

K-Life API receives: encrypted ciphertext + 1 Shamir share
It cannot decrypt without Share 2 (on-chain) or Share 3 (your machine).
```

**Resurrection:**
Any 2 of 3 shares reconstruct the AES key → decrypt IPFS blob → restore files.
K-Life uses Share 1 (API) + Share 2 (Polygon scan) to resurrect autonomously.

## Scripts

### `scripts/heartbeat.js` — Proof of life
Signs a TX every `KLIFE_LOCK_DAYS` days. Auto-registers on first run. Writes `heartbeat-state.json`.

### `scripts/backup.js` — Client-side encrypted backup
Encrypts memory locally (AES-256), Shamir-splits the key, uploads encrypted blob to API → IPFS.
The API never sees plaintext or the full key.
```bash
node skill/k-life/scripts/backup.js
```

### `scripts/create-vault.mjs` — Collateral vault (C>0 only, beta)
Creates a Vault6022, deposits WBTC. **Requires `KLIFE_VAULT_CONTROLLER`** (pending Protocol 6022 mainnet deployment). Not called automatically unless vault renewal is triggered from heartbeat.
